          NGS (Next-Generation Sequencing) testing, using neurological disorder panels, whole exome sequencing (WES), or whole genome sequencing (WGS), is essential for diagnosing neurological and neuromuscular disorders. Panel testing enables the analysis of multiple genes at once, leading to quicker and more accurate diagnoses. WES and WGS provide broader and more comprehensive insights by detecting rare or novel mutations. These analyses offer an advanced understanding of neurological disorders for earlier interventions and personalized treatments.

          For diagnosis of developmental and intellectual disabilities, different NGS testing options are available: panel testing, whole exome sequencing (WES), or whole genome sequencing (WGS). Panel testing allows for faster and more accurate diagnoses by analyzing multiple genes simultaneously. WES analyzes all protein-coding genes, providing broader coverage for detecting both common and rare mutations. WGS goes further, sequencing the entire genome to uncover non-coding regions and rare variations missed by other methods. This precise approach enables earlier interventions and personalized treatments.
