        Dr. Marija Vujadinović is an experienced specialist in molecular
        biotechnology, with over 15 years of expertise in vaccine development,
        vaccine GMP manufacturing, and molecular techniques, built on extensive
        research experience in academia and the pharmaceutical industry. As the
        Founder, Director, and Chief Technology Officer of ATENA Genomics, Dr.
        Marija Vujadinović is advancing next-generation sequencing (NGS)
        technologies to improve oncology, hereditary disease screening, prenatal
        testing, pharmacogenomics, and infectious disease diagnostics across the
        Balkans. Her journey into advanced biotechnology began with a PhD in
        Vaccine Development from the Medical Faculty at the University of
        Amsterdam (AMC-UVA) and Janssen Vaccines and Prevention, where she
        specialized in designing and optimizing adenoviral vectored vaccines.
        This experience shaped her focus on developing innovative vaccine
        technologies to enhance immune response. Dr. Vujadinović&apos;s
        expertise is further supported by dual MSc degrees in Biomolecular
        Sciences Cell Biology and Management, Policy Analysis & Entrepreneurship
        from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. Her roots in biotechnology trace back
        to a BSc in Life Sciences Molecular Cell Biology, providing a solid
        technical foundation. Resulting in a blend of science and strategy that
        equips her to translate complex research into effective healthcare
        solutions. At Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, Dr.
        Vujadinović played a key role in advancing vaccine candidates from early
        development to clinical application. As a Drug Substance Technical
        Integrator in Vaccine Process and Analytical Development, she
        coordinated GMP manufacturing and technical transfers, working closely
        with cross-functional teams to ensure smooth project execution. Her
        leadership facilitated successful project delivery, strategic risk
        management, and adherence to strict GMP standards. As a Scientist in
        Viral Vaccines at Janssen Vaccine and Prevention, she led a team focused
        on optimizing the manufacturability and early-stage development of
        adenoviral vectors. Her responsibilities ranged from study design to
        data analysis, enabling vaccine candidates to transition effectively
        from laboratory development to large-scale production. Dr. Vujadinović
        has also contributed to patents and published research on HPV and
        adenoviral platforms. Prior to her work at Janssen, Dr. Vujadinović
        advanced her technical expertise as a Lab Technician at the University
        of Utah&apos;s Department of Pathology, conducting research on Borrelia
        burgdorferi. At VU University Medical Center (VUMC) in Medical
        Microbiology and Infection Control, she further developed her skills in
        molecular diagnostics and data analysis, building a strong foundation in
        molecular research and infectious disease control. Dr.
        Vujadinović&apos;s expertise is supported by prestigious certifications,
        including Genetic Testing and Sequencing Technologies and Cancer
        Genomics and Precision Oncology from Harvard. Her work combines
        creativity, technical precision, and a strong commitment to advancing
        biotechnology for practical, real-world applications, continually
        raising standards molecular biotechnology. Marija&apos;s personal
